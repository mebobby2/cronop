# cronop

## Development
1. make manifests (generates the CRDs, roles, and webhook k8s definitions)
2. make install (installs the CRD into the k8s cluster)
3. make run (run the controller on local machine against a k8s cluster)

Now that we know it's working, we can run it in the cluster

Before that: Now that the controller is runnable, play with it and understand how all the code works
